# CNN for the CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Overview
The **CIFAR-10 dataset** comprises 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 distinct classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The classes include airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects.

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are particularly adept at image classification tasks. They are designed to learn spatial hierarchies of features from images automatically and adaptively. CNNs have found success in various applications, from facial and object recognition to powering vision in robots and autonomous vehicles.

## Network Architecture
A typical CNN for CIFAR-10 classification includes:
- **Convolutional Layers**: For feature extraction.
- **Pooling Layers**: For spatial dimension reduction.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: For classification.
- **Normalization Layers**: Such as Batch Normalization, to stabilize and speed up training.

## Training and Evaluation
To train a CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset:
1. Use a framework like **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**.
2. Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
3. Preprocess the images.
4. Define the network architecture.
5. Train the model using optimization algorithms like **SGD** or **Adam**.

After training, evaluate the model on the test set to determine its accuracy.
